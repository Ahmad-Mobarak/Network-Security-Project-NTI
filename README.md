## 📌 Project Scope

1. **Network Naming & IP Allocation**  
   🔹 Device naming and IP addressing.  
   🔹 Subnetting and LAN-to-LAN connectivity testing.  

2. **Dynamic Routing (OSPF)**  
   🔹 OSPF configuration across routers.  
   🔹 OSPF authentication for secure route updates.  

3. **Network Services (Syslog, NTP, SSH)**  
   🔹 Centralized Syslog logging.  
   🔹 Time synchronization via NTP.  
   🔹 Secure remote access with SSH.  

4. **AAA Security (RADIUS, TACACS+, Local)**  
   🔹 Authentication and authorization with fallback options.  

5. **Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)**  
   🔹 Zone definitions: Inside, Outside, DMZ.  
   🔹 Security rules to filter and control traffic.  

6. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
   🔹 Host-specific access for ICMP, SSH, and HTTP.  
   🔹 Mitigation of basic network attacks.  

7. **Site-to-Site VPN (IPsec)**  
   🔹 Secure encrypted tunnel between remote branch sites.  

8. **VLAN Segmentation & L2 Security**  
   🔹 Management VLAN and Data VLANs.  
   🔹 Inter-VLAN routing and Layer 2 security features.
